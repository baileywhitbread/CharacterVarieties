# epolys
We have computed E-polynomials of character varieties associated to general reductive groups. 

Using Jean Michel's package 'Chevie', these polynomials are computable in Julia. 

I have written some Julia code that computes these E-polynomials. 

This works on Julia v1.10.2 using the Chevie version dated April 12th 2024.
